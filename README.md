# #PartiBadge

The #PartiBadge is a Wi-Fi connected, full-featured, Particle-powered conference badge. Because who want to wear a piece of plastic around their neck when they can wear a PCB?

The #PartiBadge was designed by the Particle team and is currently used as an interactive learning platform for conferences and other developer events.

The hardware folder contains Eagle design files for iterations of the badge hardware. Since the original creation of the Electron-based PartiBadge in the Spring of 2018, there have been two additional major iterations to support the Photon (v2) and Mesh-based hardware (v3).

The firmware folder contains firmware for the latest version of the badge, currently v3.

The finished badge includes:

1.  A 1" OLED Screen
2.  An SMD Piezo buzzer
3.  A SPDT Switch
4.  A 5-way joystick
5.  An SMD Si7021 temperature and Humidity sensor
6.  4 Tactile LED Buttons in Red, Blue, Green and Yellow/Orange
7.  An I2C-Compatible breakout for #BadgeLife add-ons
